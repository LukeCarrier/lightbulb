LightBulb
=========

LightBulb is my latest Python project. When complete, it will enable you to compile a
LAMP stack (well, a web server, a few scripting languages and a database server)
without having to write your own configure parameters and play with Makefiles.

Note: it's still very much in development and is far from being complete. In fact, at
the time of writing, I'm still only just planning out the build profile format and how
we're going to modularise the various different applications and utilities you'll be
able to compile.
